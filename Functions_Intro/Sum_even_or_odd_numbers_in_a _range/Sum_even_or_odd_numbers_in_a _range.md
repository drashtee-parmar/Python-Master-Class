Sum even or odd numbers in a range
In this coding exercise, you have to write a function named sum_eo with the following parameters:

n: a positive number

t: a str



If t has the value 'e', the function should return the sum of all even natural numbers less than n.

Else if t has the value 'o', the function should return the sum of all odd natural numbers less than n.

For any other values of t return -1.



Examples:



1. sum_eo(10, 'e') should return 20, since 2 + 4 + 6 + 8 = 20



2. sum_eo(7, 'o') should return 9, since 1 + 3 + 5 = 9



3. sum_eo(11, 'spam') should return -1
