# Fizz Buzz
Develop the code for this exercise in your IDE. This on-line Python interpreter can execute your code, and check the results, but it's not an IDE.

You won't get meaningful error messages, for one thing.

Once you think your code works, copy and paste the code in here, to complete the exercise.



For this exercise, you'll write a function that returns the appropriate response, in the game of fizz buzz.

It's a simple game, usually played with 2 or more people.

You start counting, in turn. That's easy enough, but there's a complication.

If the number is divisible by 3, you say "fizz" instead.

If it's divisible by 5, you say "buzz".

And if it's divisible by both 3 and 5, you say "fizz buzz".



The function must be called fizz_buzz



Your fizz_buzz function should return the correct word ("fizz", "buzz" or "fizz buzz"), or the number if it's not divisible by either 3 or 5.

The function will always return a string. When you return the number, therefore, you should convert it to a string first.



Remember to annotate your function, and include a Docstring.



Include a for loop, to test your function for values from 1 to 100, inclusive.
